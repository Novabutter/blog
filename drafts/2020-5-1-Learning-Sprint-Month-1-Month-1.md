## MONTH 1 - MONTH 1 Learning

This is a weekly learning sprint update. The purpose is to outline my goals and tasks of learning throughout the week. At the end of each weekly I will evaluate my completed and incomplete tasks hoping to identify and streamline my best working/learning habits. Additionally, those that read here can see what I’m up to and track my weekly progress. For a larger outlook on what I’m up to, check out my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/6oD5SGbb/personal-board) which changes daily & is what my weeks are based off of.
